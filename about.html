      </div>
      <div class=" text-center">
        <p>Solar monitoring is the practice of continuously monitoring and analyzing the performance and output of solar
          power systems. It involves the use of monitoring devices, sensors, and software to collect data on various
          parameters related to the solar energy generation process.
          At American Green Solutions, we specialize in providing solar monitoring systems for residential, commercial,
          and utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) installations. Our main objective is to ensure the efficient and
          optimal functioning of your solar power system while identifying any issues or anomalies that may arise.
          Our solar monitoring system features a user-friendly dashboard that allows you to access all your system's
          data in one place, whether through a desktop application or email notifications. The recorded data is
          presented in graph form, providing valuable insights into the performance of your solar energy system.

            Remote asset monitoring refers to the process of connecting to and monitoring assets from a remote location
            using Internet of Things (IoT) technology. It allows businesses to gather real-time data from their assets,
            such as equipment, machinery, or infrastructure, and stream that data to a centralized cloud platform for
            analysis and visualization.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Hark Platform, an Intel® IoT Market Ready Solution, provides the tools for remote asset monitoring. By
            connecting assets to the platform, businesses can track and analyze various parameters such as performance
            metrics, energy consumption, operational status, and more. The platform uses IoT sensors, gateways, and
            communication protocols to collect data from the assets and transmit it securely to the cloud.
          </p>
          <p>
            With remote asset monitoring, businesses can detect anomalies in asset operation and identify potential
            issues or maintenance needs. The platform can generate alerts and notifications based on predefined
            thresholds or abnormal patterns, allowing maintenance teams to prioritize and address critical issues
            promptly. By implementing predictive maintenance strategies based on real-time asset data, businesses can
            reduce operational costs, increase efficiency, and optimize asset performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, remote asset monitoring plays a significant role in helping businesses achieve their
            sustainability goals, such as reaching net-zero targets. By continuously monitoring asset performance and
            energy consumption, organizations can identify opportunities for energy optimization, resource efficiency,
            and emissions reduction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, remote asset monitoring empowers businesses to make data-driven decisions, improve maintenance
            practices, optimize asset performance, and drive operational efficiency, all from a remote location.

        <h4>Our Inception: The Turning Point for the Industry</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="section-body">
        <p>In a pivotal moment for the solar industry in 2016, a visionary team of three solar experts embarked on a
          mission. While the industry was witnessing rapid growth in residential and commercial solar sales, there was a
          pressing need for a comprehensive solution to address performance issues. The prevailing approach was
          encapsulated in two letters: O&M (Operations and Maintenance).</p>
        <p>
          The problem with O&M was twofold. Firstly, performance issues were often deprioritized behind new sales,
          leading to delays in addressing system problems. Secondly, many original sellers were facing business failures
          and bankruptcies, leaving customers stranded without support. This fracture in the post-purchase experience
          was jeopardizing the return on investment for institutional buyers and homeowners alike, undermining
          confidence in renewable energy investments.

      <p> The founders of American Green Solutions brought together a wealth of industry expertise. With backgrounds in
        operations, capital management, and market expansion, they embarked on a journey of possibilities, asking
        themselves a series of thought-provoking questions: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          What if they could develop advanced technology and a dedicated team to replace responsive O&M calls with
          remote issue detection and proactive customer care?
        </li>

      <p>Originating as a division within Libsys, a prominent provider of IT services for Fortune 500 firms, the
        visionary minds behind American Green Solutions embarked on a transformative journey. As they gathered around
        the whiteboard, their ideas took shape: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          They understood that the key to launching remote performance diagnosis lay in digitalization, paving the way
          for machine learning. Their mission was to identify data patterns that would reveal the underlying causes of
          performance issues.
        </li>
        <li>
          They recognized that the potential of their technology and remote diagnostics extended beyond the solar
          industry. They saw opportunities to benefit other digitalized asset classes, such as battery technology, HVAC
          systems, and even light bulbs.
        </li>
        <li>
          With a steadfast commitment to safeguarding the performance of these asset classes, they aspired to become the
          trusted custodian of all things IoT (Internet of Things).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The name "American Green Solutions" emerged from the founders of Libsys, who brainstormed numerous naming
        concepts on the whiteboard. </p>
